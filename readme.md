# Requirement

You should not copy the code from GitHub About page. Or your code will look like a mess.

Please choose the correct tags. You should not use `<div>` for the most of the cases.

The CSS should be placed in another file. You should never put styling code into HTML page.

The page should not contain any JavaScript. The menu effect as well as other dynamic effect is not required.

# How To Preview

You can run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

And an http-server will be started listening on port 4444. You can then open a browser window and access http://localhost:4444 to preview your work. If you want to stop the http-server, please press the Ctrl+C to terminate the process.
